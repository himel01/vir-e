## Description

This project is all about an e-commerce. But what makes it different than other similar sites? Creating one stop e commerce solution for customers which will also function as a laundry and tailor store. And customer can also know how any cloth will look on him/her before ordering the product. It requires general user data like name, address, contact and also the height width measurements of the user. My target audience is everyone who currently using different e commerce website or apps and additionally people who doesn't trust e commerce sites because of measurements issue and they want to try out cloths before buying. They have to use web browsers like chrome.

To use this site you have to go to the link mentioned above (link to this project). The home page will open but there is nothing much. Because this is my first time working on websites and understanding the react framework was tough and time consuming. I am still learning and the website is not functional yet.
